## Welcome to GitHub Pages
Insert professional self assessment:
There are several items from my coursework that have helped showcase my strengths and shaped my professional goals in the computer science field. Throughout many of my courses I have learned the importance of best coding practices as well as security. When dealing with items such as databases security is a must have as it is needed to protect users data. When dealing with information and data it is of the upmost importance to protect that data. In a database such as the one I created using mongoDB, it was important to add error messages to the program so that a user can’t access data that shouldn’t be accessed. Making sure the program logic functions correctly and even indentations as in the artifacts I displayed show my understanding of the coding best practices throughout the languages and updated programs. Completing my coursework throughout this programmed has allowed me to learn new skills related to computer science as well as expanding my current knowledge.  Skills such as working as a team while learning agile and waterfall software development lifecycles have proved vital in creating programs and understanding how projects are created from start to finish. Other aspect of the program such as creating a project proposal have proven my abilities to communicate to stakeholders and completing requests for information as with a weather station I created in emerging systems and architecture class. This experience helped on my ability to create realistic and secure software/hardware specifications for a project and how to achieve those specifications. Not only was able to build these enhancements, I was able to plan out the steps of how I would achieve these enhancements throughout my computer science education.

	The artifacts I have chosen to display in my portfolio fit together as they display the knowledge and skills I have learned throughout my computer science degree. These particular projects display the knowledge in different areas but many of them show the aspects of several areas of computer science in each artifact. The first artifact I included is a OpenGL project written in C++. It is a project that shows a chair with several parts and functions. This chair is displayed in Three Dimensional graphics on the two dimensional screen. This artifact shows software designing and engineering and how the structure of the code can create an object. This particular design required planning as the coordinates system had to be aligned correctly in order to display the object in the correct dimensions as showed in the artifact.
	The second artifact is a medical application system written in the java programming language and uses J-unit tests to test the certain parts of the application. This allow for testing of the different classes and shows they are running correctly. This medical application shows how data structures and algorithms can be crucial in creating secure code while following best coding practices. This application has several features as displayed in the artifact description. As there are several different parts to the application that rely on one another, it is important to make sure that the programming logic functions correctly as shown in the application.
	The third artifact resolves around a database and more specifically mongoDB with non SQL database functionality. This artifact is used for querying information from different parts of a database. The database queries must also be secure as it deals with company and user information. This artifact employs CRUD functionality to access information. These coding best practices as shown in the artifact allow the code to have full functionality while being secure. Functions such as error messages being displayed when an incorrect operation occurs allows for information to be secured and helps to stop unauthorized access.
